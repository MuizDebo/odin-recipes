   <h2>Homemade Organic Yogurt</h2>

   <p>Creamy, tangy, and completely natural—this homemade organic yogurt is a nourishing treat that’s easy to prepare and free from additives or preservatives.</p>
   <p>Making organic yogurt at home is a rewarding and simple process that only requires two ingredients. Not only does it save money in the long run, but it also gives you full control over what goes into your body. This recipe produces a smooth and mildly tangy yogurt that’s perfect on its own, with fruits, or used in cooking and baking. The key is to use high-quality organic milk and a good starter culture (which can be a bit of plain organic yogurt). Let’s dive into the process!</p>
   
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1 liter of organic whole milk (preferably grass-fed)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of plain organic yogurt with live active cultures (as a starter)</li>
   </ul>
  
   <h3>Instructions</h3>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Heat the milk:</strong> Pour the organic milk into a clean saucepan and slowly heat it over medium flame until it reaches about 85°C (185°F). Stir occasionally to prevent a skin from forming or scorching at the bottom.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool the milk:</strong> Remove the saucepan from heat and allow the milk to cool down to about 43–46°C (110–115°F). This is the optimal temperature range for culturing yogurt.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the starter:</strong> In a small bowl, mix the starter yogurt with a few tablespoons of the cooled milk until smooth. Then stir it back into the rest of the milk, mixing gently to combine.</li>
    <li><strong>Incubate:</strong> Pour the milk mixture into a clean jar or container. Cover it with a lid or clean cloth and keep it in a warm place (like an oven with the light on, or wrapped in a towel) for 6 to 12 hours. The longer it incubates, the tangier and thicker it becomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> After the incubation period, check if the yogurt has set to your desired consistency. If so, move it to the fridge to chill and firm up further.</li>
    <li><strong>Store and enjoy:</strong> Once cooled, your organic yogurt is ready to eat! Store it in the refrigerator and consume within 7–10 days.</li>
   </ol>
